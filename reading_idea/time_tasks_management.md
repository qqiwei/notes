### Time and Tasks Management

#### 1. **B**ullet **J**ournal (the Simple and Electronic version of Mine :laughing:)

1. <u>one collection</u> for all tasks
2. tasks into the *<u>calendar</u>* [will all be settled without exception]
   1. :heavy_check_mark: done
   2. :arrow_heading_down: moved to the next day or to the future, or​ just :x: removed
3. <u>another collection</u> for project plans, learning notes, or some other lists

#### 2. **G**etting **T**hings **D**one (when you know little about the things/tasks you will have to do​)

1. ideas of GTD
   1. stress free for your brain
   
   2. handle with your tasks [neither to finish all of them nor to do at once]
   
      (i personally see this GTD as small, specific and supplementary principles of my Bullet Journal, not just First Things First, or the Eisenhower Box, but all natures of tasks like "important or not, urgent or not, or even in or out" should be taken into condirection when you are in front of a task)
2. tasks handling
   1. not just ~~collect~~ but to **capture** the tasks, into the <u>inbox</u> (maybe just a sticky note)
   2. not just ~~process~~ but to **classify**, **organize** the tasks, into different boxes (as collections in a Bullet Journal) and the *<u>calendar</u>* like this: 
      1. if the task is not my job (as a waiting task), mark the next checking time in your *<u>calendar</u>* or simply set an alarm clock on that day
      2. else if a date is fixed for the task, into your *<u>calendar</u>* or so 
      3. else if not doable in the near feature, into boxes of <u>reference</u>, or <u>future tasks</u>
      4. else if not complicated (i.e. can be done in 2 minutes or so), you may do it at once
      5. else,  
         1. planning (as a task itself into the <u>inbox</u> or the box of <u>future tasks</u>)
         2. the plan maybe put into a box of <u>planed project</u>, with each step of which a task
   3. not just ~~plan~~ but also **check**/**reflect** on the tasks(in the *<u>calendar</u>* or other boxes) every day, every three days or every week. not just ~~do~~ but to **engage** in the job, and **ask for the result** on your own initiative 

#### 3. The Feynman Technique (for Learning Something :blush:)

1. Have a *<u>Concept</u>* in your mind
2. Explain in *<u>Simple</u>* Language
3. Look for *<u>Gaps</u>* in your Knowlage
4. Fill in the Gap, then *<u>Repeat</u>* the Process

#### 4. The Pomodoro Technique (for working on something you do not want to do​)

1. the Steps
   1. Choose your Tasks or SubTasks
   2. Set the Timer to 25 minutes
   3. Work 25 minutes and break for 5 minutes as one Pomodora
   4. Rest for 10 minutes after 4 Pomodoras
2. the Rules
   1. Fully Focus
      1. *No Distraction at all*, like Phone on Silent or No Checking News
      2. No Interuption by People if Not Urgent 
         :one: Inform him or her What you are doing now
         :two: ​Negotiate the time of your calling back and so on
   2. Break for Water or Walking, and just Away from your Study Erea
   3. You may Skip a Break on Reviewing or thoroughly Researching 
   4. Learning to Know Yourself and the Tasks

#### 5. do not use your willpower :rocket: 

1. change the *<u>environment</u>* rather than change the people (reduce the resistance)
2. bring in some *<u>motivation</u>* (load enough fuel) 
   1. remind yourself of your goal once a week helps 
   2. financial incentives work a little better, no matter how much an inventive is,
      but loss aversion (we hate losing more than we enjoy gaining) works better
   4. reminder from our loved ones works almost equally to the loss aversion
   5. ceremony (for being aware of the other invisible activities going on underneath the loss right now) works best
